			<h1>Childfree</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; In the last two decades, researchers have been concerned with the
				growth of the child-free phenomenon in many first-world nations with
				multiple dimensions of modernity (Bhambhani, 2020). A lot of theories
				and opinions have emerged to address this phenomenon.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; The childfree phenomenon has divided people&apos;s views into two
				groups. First, 60.8% of the populace denies the legality of the
				child-free phenomenon in the middle of society. Second, the other 39.8%
				of the people are willing to be more open and agree with the application
				of childfree in their lives.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Researchers&apos; findings have shown that the group who agreed
				with the application of childfree have a few reasons, some of them are:
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					It is in everyone&apos;s right. Choice, personal decisions, and
					consequences have become that person&apos;s responsibility.
				</li>
				<li>They have logical reasoning.</li>
				<li>
					Plenty of older people are not ready to have a child, whether in the
					aspect of readied to teach or to finance.
				</li>
				<li>To have a child is not a responsibility.</li>
				<li>Not everyone can create a child.</li>
				<li>
					Many children have become the target of anger, failure, and
					disappointment their parents have felt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Some parent regards their children as a form of long-term investment,
					which is when the child has become an adult and could work to help
					finance daily and household needs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Children have the right to have a parent who is qualified and
					competent.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				&emsp; Meanwhile, the contrasting groups have opposite opinions. Some of
				them are:
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Because it abolishes women&apos;s nature (to conceive, feed, and give
					birth).
				</li>
				<li>Child-free could destroy the generation chain.</li>
				<li>Children are the gift from God.</li>
				<li>It is not following the law of Indonesia.</li>
			</ol>
