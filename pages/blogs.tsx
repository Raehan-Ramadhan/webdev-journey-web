				<h1>Childfree</h1>
				<p>
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					{" "}
					In the last two decades, researchers have been concerned with the
					growth of the child-free phenomenon in many first-world nations with
					multiple dimensions of modernity (Bhambhani, 2020). A lot of theories
					and opinions have emerged to address this phenomenon.
				</p>
				<p>
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					{" "}
					The childfree phenomenon has divided people&apos;s views into two
					groups. First, 60.8% of the populace denies the legality of the
					child-free phenomenon in the middle of society. Second, the other
					39.8% of the people are willing to be more open and agree with the
					application of childfree in their lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					{" "}
					Researchers&apos; findings have shown that the group who agreed with
					the application of childfree have a few reasons, some of them are:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						It is in everyone&apos;s right. Choice, personal decisions, and
						consequences have become that person&apos;s responsibility.
					</li>
					<li>They have logical reasoning.</li>
					<li>
						Plenty of older people are not ready to have a child, whether in the
						aspect of readied to teach or to finance.
					</li>
					<li>To have a child is not a responsibility.</li>
					<li>Not everyone can create a child.</li>
					<li>
						Many children have become the target of anger, failure, and
						disappointment their parents have felt.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some parent regards their children as a form of long-term
						investment, which is when the child has become an adult and could
						work to help finance daily and household needs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Children have the right to have a parent who is qualified and
						competent.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					{" "}
					Meanwhile, the contrasting groups have opposite opinions. Some of them
					are:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Because it abolishes women&apos;s nature to conceive, feed, and give
						birth.
					</li>
					<li>Child-free could destroy the generation chain.</li>
					<li>Children are the gift from God.</li>
					<li>It is not following the law of Indonesia.</li>
					<li>
						Because if no factor endangers the mother or the child, for example,
						in health and psychology, perhaps the childfree is just a matter of
						the partners&apos; selfishness.
					</li>
					<li>
						Because having a child is part of human nature, furthermore from a
						social aspect, having a child is essential because we can&apos;t
						live alone.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There is also a group with neutral beliefs. Their statements are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						&quot;The truth is, I am in a position of agreeing and
						disagreeing.&quot;
					</li>
					<li>
						&quot;I couldn&apos;t decisively say agree or disagree because
						plenty of other things need to be considered first before
						deciding.&quot;
					</li>
				</ol>
